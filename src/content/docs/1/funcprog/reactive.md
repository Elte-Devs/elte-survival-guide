- weird history
  - pure reactive language: Svelte 4
  - why pure is bad (pure reactive, pure functional)
- we will use: Svelte 5, Solid
- observer pattern: signals
- state, derived, effect
- learning to lose reactivity to not cause infinite loops (note: these are actually caught by the compiler, unlike with other languages I could mention *cough* haskell)
